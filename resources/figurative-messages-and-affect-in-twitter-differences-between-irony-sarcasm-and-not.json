Such devices, in fact, can influence and twist the polarity of an utterance in different ways. A new dataset of over 10,000 tweets including a high variety of figurative language types, manually annotated with sentiment scores, has been released in the context of the task 11 of SemEval-2015. In this paper, we propose an analysis of the tweets in the dataset to investigate the open research issue of how separated figurative linguistic phenomena irony and sarcasm are, with a special focus on the role of features related to the multi-faceted affective information expressed in such texts. We considered for our analysis tweets tagged with #irony and #sarcasm, and also the tag #not, which has not been studied in depth before. A distribution and correlation analysis over a set of features, including a wide variety of psycholinguistic and emotional features, suggests arguments for the separation between irony and sarcasm. The outcome is a novel set of sentiment, structural and psycholinguistic features evaluated in binary classification experiments. We report about classification experiments carried out on a previously used corpus for #irony vs #sarcasm. We outperform in terms of F-measure the stateof-the-art results on this dataset. Overall, our results confirm the difficulty of the task, but introduce new data-driven arguments for the separation between #irony and #sarcasm. Interestingly, #not emerges as a distinct phenomenon."

                        "The use of figurative devices such as irony and sarcasm has\nbeen proven to be a pervasive phenomenon on social media\nplatforms such as Twitter and poses a significant challenge to\nsentiment analysis systems, since irony-laden expressions can play the\nrole of polarity reversers [1]. Irony and sarcasm can influence and\ntwist the affect of an utterance in complex and different ways.\nThey can elicit various affective reactions, and can behave\ndifferently with respect to the polarity reversal phenomenon, as shown\nin [2]. However, the issue of distinguishing between such devices\nis still poorly understood. In particular, the question of whether\nirony and sarcasm are separated or similar linguistic phenomena\nis a controversial issue in literature and no clear consensus has\nalready been reached. Although some researchers consider them\nstrongly related figurative devices, other authors proposed a\nseparation: sarcasm is offensive, more aggressive than irony [3,4] and\ndelivered with a cutting tone (rarely ambiguous), whereas irony\noften exhibits great subtlety and has been considered more similar\nto mocking in a sharp and non-offensive manner [5]. Furthermore,\nthere is a consistent body of work on computational models for\nsarcasm detection [6] and irony detection [7] in social media, but\nonly preliminary studies addressed the task to distinguish sarcasm\nand irony [8,9].",
                        "In this paper we contribute to the debate of whether irony\nand sarcasm are similar or distinct phenomena by investigating\nhow hashtags marking a figurative intent are used in Twitter. Our\nexperiments concern a rich corpus of figurative messages. We\nconsidered tweets marked with the user-generated tags #irony\nand #sarcasm, as such tags reflect a tacit belief about what\nconstitutes irony and sarcasm, respectively [7]. We extend our\nanalysis also to tweets tagged with hashtag #not, previously used\nto retrieve sarcastic tweets [6,10], in order to investigate further\ntheir figurative meaning. Samples of tweets marked with different\nhashtags follow:\n(tw1) Fun fact of the day: No one knows who invented the fire\nhydrant because its patent was destroyed in a fire. #irony\n(tw2) I just love it when I speak to folk and they totally ignore\nme!!! #Sarcasm!\n(tw3) So I just colored with Ava for an hour. Yeah my summer so\nfar has been so fun [smiling face emoji] #not",
                        "Our methodology comprehends two steps. First, we performed\na distribution and correlation analysis relying on the dataset of\nSemEval2015-Task11 [1], which includes samples of the kinds of\nfigurative messages under consideration here (step 1). We explored\nthe use of the three hashtags including structural as well as\npsycholinguistic and affective features concerning emotional\ninformation.",
                        "The affective information expressed in the dataset is\nmultifaceted. Both sentiment and emotion lexicons, as well as\npsycholinguistic resources available for English, refer to various affective\nmodels and capture different facets of affect, such as sentiment\npolarity, emotional categories and emotional dimensions. Some of such\nresources, i.e., SenticNet [11] and EmoSenticNet [12], are not flat\nvocabularies of affective words, but include and model semantic,\nconceptual and affective information associated with multi-word\nnatural language expressions, by enabling concept-level analysis of\nsentiment and emotions conveyed in texts. In our view, all such\nresources represent a rich and varied lexical knowledge about affect,\nunder different perspectives, therefore we propose here a\ncomprehensive study of their use in the context of our analysis, in order\nto test if they convey relevant knowledge to distinguishing\ndifferent kinds of figurative messages.",
                        "The analysis provided valuable insights on three kinds of\nfigurative messages, including different ways to influence and twist the\naffective content. The outcome is a novel set of features evaluated\nin binary classification experiments (step 2). To better understand\nthe impact of each feature, we evaluated our model performing\nexperiments with different subset combinations, proceeding also by\nfeature ablation, i.e. removing one feature at time in order to\nevaluate its contribution on the results.",
                        "To sum up, our experiments address the following research\nquestions:\n1. Is it possible to distinguish irony from sarcasm?\n2. What is the role of the #not hashtag as a figurative language\ndevice? Is it a synonym of irony, of sarcasm, or something in\nbetween?\n3. Does information about sentiment and psycholinguistics\nfeatures help in distinguishing among #irony, #sarcasm and\n#not tweets?\n4. What is the role of the polarity reversal in the three kinds\nof figurative messages?",

                        "As for the separation of #irony vs #not and #sarcasm vs #not,\ninterestingly, #not emerges as a distinct phenomenon. Analysis of\nthe relevance of each feature in the model confirms the\nsignificance of sentiment and psycholinguistics features. Finally, an\ninteresting finding about polarity reversal is given by correlation\nstudy presented in Section 4.2.3: the polarity reversal phenomenon\nseems to be relevant in messages marked with #sarcasm and #not,\nwhile it is less relevant for messages tagged with #irony.",

                        "Many authors embrace an overall view on irony. Broadly\nspeaking, under the umbrella term of irony one can find distinct\nphenomena such as situational irony or verbal irony [13?15]. Situational\nirony (or ?irony of fate?) refers to the state of affairs or events\nwhich is the reverse of what has been expected, while the term\nverbal irony is applied to refer to a figure of speech,\ncharacterized by the possibility of distinguishing between a literal and an\nintended/implied meaning. In particular, according to many\ntheoretical accounts in ironic utterances the speaker intends to\ncommunicate the opposite of what is literally said [16,17], but since\nsuch definition does not allow to account for many samples of\nutterances which are considered ironic, we prefer to refer to a more\ngeneral position, on which different authors in literature would\ntacitly agree: ?Regardless of the type, or absence, of meaning\nnegation/reversal, the literal import of an ironic utterance differs from\nthe implicit meaning the speaker intends to communicate? [15].\nMoreover, we can have an ironic statement, meant as utterance of\na speaker which refers to certain aspects of an ironic situation [13].",
                        "In linguistics, verbal irony is sometimes used as a synonym of\nsarcasm [18?20]. According to the literature, boundaries in\nmeaning between irony, sarcasm et similia are fuzzy. While some\nauthors consider irony as an umbrella term covering also sarcasm\n[16,21,22], others provide insights for a separation. Sarcasm has\nbeen recognized in [23] with a specific target to attack [4,15], more\noffensive [3] and ?intimately associated with particular negative\naffective states? [24]. According to [3] hearers perceive\naggressiveness as the feature that distinguishes sarcasm. Instead, irony has\nbeen considered more similar to mocking in a sharp and\nnonoffensive manner [5].",

However, a variety of typologies\nof figurative messages can be recognized in tweets: from irony to\nsarcastic posts, and to facetious tweets that can be playful, aimed\nat amusing or at strengthening ties with other users. Ironic and\nsarcastic devices can express different interpersonal meaning, elicit\ndifferent affective reactions, and can behave differently with\nrespect to the polarity reversal phenomenon [2]. Therefore, to\ndistinguish between them can be important for improving the\nperformances of systems in sentiment analysis.",
                        "For computational linguistics purposes irony and sarcasm are\noften viewed as the same figurative language device.\nComputational models for sarcasm detection [6,9,26?28] and irony\ndetection [7,29,30] in social media has been proposed, mostly focussed\non Twitter. Only a few preliminary studies addressed the task to\ninvestigate the differences between irony and sarcasm [8,9]. The\ncurrent work aims to further contribute to this subject.",
                        "Furthermore, a rarely investigated form of irony that can be\ninteresting to study in social media is self-mockery. Self-mockery\nseems to be different from other forms of irony, also from sarcasm,\nbecause it does not involve contempt for others, but the speaker\nwishes to dissociate from the content of the utterance.\nAccording to some theoretical accounts: ?Self-mockery usually involves\na speaker making an utterance and then immediately denying or\ninvalidating its consequence, often by saying something like ?No, I\nwas just kidding??
