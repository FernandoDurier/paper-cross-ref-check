We investigate attitudes to news delivered by social media, and subsequent verification strategies applied, or not applied, by individuals. A survey reveals that two thirds of respondents regularly consumed news via Facebook, and that one third had at some point come across fake news that they initially believed to be true. An analysis task involving news presented via Facebook reveals a diverse range of judgement forming strategies, with participants relying on personal judgements as to plausibility and scepticism around sources and journalistic style. This reflects a shift away from traditional methods of accessing the news, and highlights the difficulties in combating the spread of fake news."

It is however suggested [\n        \n        ] that the\nprevalence of fake news requires a broader definition that\nencompasses multiple forms and alternative motives:\nhumorous fakes in the form of news satire; large scale\nhoaxes, where audiences are deliberately deceived about a\nnews story; and serious fabrication, where events are\nsensationalized, a method allegedly used by many tabloids.\nWhile phrases such as ?fake news? may have specific local\nconnotations ? particularly in the United States ? they also\nflow globally in the digital age. In the UK and Europe ?fake\nnews? is a phrase that has been imported, but one routinely\nused to interchangeably describe the above.

In the US, while the majority may not\nintentionally turn to Facebook to look for news, it was found\nthat two thirds of Facebook users do actually get their news\nfrom there, accounting for 44% of the American population\n[\n        \n        ]. In the UK, 29% say they read or shared news on\nFacebook in the last week [\n        \n        ].

                    "SURVEYING SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS CONSUMPTION\nWe began by designing a descriptive online survey, to gather\ninformation about contemporary news consumption via\nsocial media. We also explored to what extent respondents\nbelieved that they paid attention to news delivered to them in\nthis fashion, whether and how they reflected on the veracity\nof such news, whether they had encountered purportedly\nfake news and, if so, how they had reacted to it.",
                    "The survey was advertised via an online survey tool, and\nsnowballed from institutional mailing lists. There were 309\nrespondents who completed the survey in May 2017. 41.1%\nmale, 55.7% female, and respondents? ages ranged from\n1825 to over 66, however the majority were in the 18-25\nbracket (70.4%). Respondents predominantly identified\nthemselves as being students (71%). All were from the UK.\nInitially the survey asked respondents about what they\nconsidered to be news, and the channels by which they\ntended to access it. 34% of respondents accessed news on the\ntelevision at least once a day, with 80% accessing online\nnews sources. Notably 65% of respondents reported\naccessing news via their Facebook feeds (i.e. shared by\nfriends, subscriptions to news agencies, suggested\nautomatically by Facebook) at least once a day; however\nonly 20% obtained ?most? of their news via Facebook. This\nsuggests that the consumption of news via social media is\nprolific but also perceived to be to an extent coincidental.\nWe next asked about the kind of news that was accessed via\nsocial media. Here the most popular were breaking news\n(69%), politics (45%), international (42%) and entertainment\n(40%). When asked to describe factors that were used to\ndetermine whether a post, article or link seen on social media\nwas news or not, respondents referred to information coming\nfrom a source that they considered to be ?reputable?, many\nincluding the BBC, and others referencing ?mainstream TV\nnews channels or broadsheet newspapers? including The\nGuardian, Reuters and CNN. In addition, 46% of\nrespondents highlighted ?new information? referring to a\ncurrent event as an important factor, while 20% referred to\nnews being ?factual?, ?accurate? or ?something of interest?.\nAsked to give examples of a news story encountered through\nsocial media, popular responses included stories covering\nrecent terror attacks, the activities of Donald Trump, Brexit,\nand a passenger violently removed from a United Airlines\nflight. However, only 61% of respondents went through to\nread the full story, with the remainder commenting that they\ndid not have the time or interest to devote to it, or notably\nthat sufficient information was given in the headline\npresented in the social media feed. Of those who did read the\narticle either in full or in part, only 55% believed that the\nheadline accurately matched the content.",

Here\nrespondents stated that they identified the piece of news in\nquestion as fake predominantly by fact-checking against\nother sources, or using their own reasoning that something\neither could not be true or seemed implausible. Conversely,\n46% had come across a news item they immediately\nidentified as fake, principally based on knowledge of the\nsource as satire ? ?The Onion?, ?Daily Mash?, or being known\nto exaggerate ? ?because it was the Daily Mail?, or again\nthrough their own reasoning and judgements of plausibility.\nOur survey results suggest that social media users are not\nonly incidentally consuming news via sites such as\nFacebook, but they are aware of ? and encountering ? fake\nnews, some of which is taken at face value.

Our aim\nwas to prompt participants to draw upon and elucidate their\neveryday practices when engaging with news in this manner.\nWe constructed a fictitious Facebook account belonging to\n?Leo Porter? to mirror the sort of news feed that users might\nencounter day to day whilst using their own Facebook\naccount. We populated the Facebook account with a variety\nof news posts, which were interspersed with other posts\nrelating to Leo?s day to day activities, travel and life plans.\n13 news posts were manually selected from among those\nreported in the survey as stories encountered by participants\non social media. They were chosen to provide a mixture of\nreal and fake news, including obviously mundane but also\nimplausible real news, and fake news from a number of\nsources again following Rubin?s [\n        \n        ] typology of satire,\nexaggeration and hoax, from the mundane to the unusual:\nFake: ?Donald Trump?s health deteriorates?, ?Donald\nTrump threatens Russia over ban on Jehovah's Witnesses?,\n?Crayola to retire dandelion coloured crayon?, ?We can't\nafford to take refugee children?, ?Camembert to be stopped\nafter Brexit?, ?Nightclub is banning Baywatch theme song?.\nTrue: ?Texas man sues date for texting?, ?UK House Prices\nfall?, ?Rosemary can boost exam grades?, ?Schools urged to\ninstall metal detectors?, ?Zoe Saldana claims Hollywood\nbullied Trump?, ?Farmers secretly feeding cows skittles?.\nOne news story was presented both from a trustworthy and\nfrom a tabloid source. Each linked to the originating external\nnews source including the BBC, CNN, the Daily Mail, News\nThump and NY Post. The posts appeared in the same visual\nformat as if they had been posted or shared by a normal user,\nas shown in figure 1, displaying an image, headline and sub\nheadline, and source.\nParticipants were asked to take part in an activity in which\nthey were asked to browse the Facebook page, and they were\ntasked to ?look through the page and find the fake news?.\nWhilst scrolling through the page, each participant was asked\nto ?think aloud? by stating initial thoughts, judgements,\nfeelings and comments that might spring to mind when\nreading the information. A researcher prompted participants\nby following up on responses, asking further questions or\ninviting discussion on any related issue that cropped up\nduring the exercise, for example asking ?what made you\nwant to explore/examine this post further?, or ?what makes\nyou not pay any particular attention to this??. Once the\nactivity was completed, each participant was invited to take\npart in a further interview, with semi-structured interview\nquestions being directed to all participants including asking\nwhat their understanding of the concept of fake news was.\nEach session was audio recorded and subsequently\ntranscribed, with a screen recording capturing scrolling and\nmouse movements, and page navigation. A single researcher\nperformed an initial analysis by coding transcriptions of each\nparticipant?s activities, identifying key points in which the\nparticipants differed.

Here we present participants?\nbehaviours and approaches in detail.",
                    "Veracity based on source reliability\nWhen determining whether to believe a news story,\nparticipants showed distinct approaches which varied\nprimarily in one aspect: the attention they gave to the source\nof the story. Three categories of behaviours emerged. First,\nsome instances showed participants to fully rely on the\nauthority of the source to make judgments on whether the\nstory is true. These participants tended to look first at the\nsource before clicking the link in the post, or at the web\naddress bar afterwards. They vocalized trust or lack thereof\nof the indicated website when reasoning about truthfulness:\n?I?d say it?s real. [Researcher: Can you tell me why?]\nBecause of the source.? P9\nThis participant made explicit reference to the fact that they\nbased their judgment on the source of the article. This\nexplicit referencing came in different forms. Above, the\nparticipant was reading an article from the BBC, which they\ndeemed to be trustworthy enough. In other instances, a\nwebsite was recognised as being satirical and judged\naccordingly. Where the source was not recognized at all, the\nresulting judgment was of mistrust. For example, when\nlooking at a blog post they did not recognize:\n?Supermarkets confirm they no longer stock Camembert due\nto Brexit. Rubbish. (?) It?s not from a credible site.? P3\nIn these examples, the participant based their decision on\nwhether or not a news story was trustworthy primarily on the\nsource, as presented in the Facebook post. In a second set of\ninstances, participants expressed their belief in the article\nbefore acknowledging or looking at the source, but later\nlooked at and vocalized the source to justify their assessment.\nIn other words, they formulated their belief based on their\nown personal assessment of the believability of the news\nstory, and then later utilized the source to support this belief.\nOne participant, not aware that the website they are looking\nat is a satirical news site, made their judgment based on the\ncontent of the headline alone, before going on to add that as\nthey did not have prior knowledge of the source and that this\nwould add to the likelihood of the news being fake:\n?Oh that?s fake. (...) Well because the government wouldn?t\nsay that. And also it?s the website NewsThump. I?ve never\nheard of that before.? P8\nThis sometimes went the other way, and acknowledgement\nof the source made them question their original assessment,\nresulting in qualifying the original belief or completely\nchanging it. A somewhat incredulous participant passed\njudgement on a story on CNN about a man suing his date for\ntexting during a film prior to referencing the source. Once\nthe source was recognized however, the assessment was\naltered based on CNN?s perceived reliability.\n?Initial thoughts is that it must be a joke, but then looking,\nit?s not impossible (...) It says it?s CNN. CNN are generally\nrespectable. (...) So I?m likely to think this could be true.? P7\nA further element of the source probed in the subsequent\ninterview was the person that might have posted or shared a\nparticular story, and participants indeed highlighted the value\nthey see in reading news stories shared by those they respect.\n?If it?s somebody I know well, then I?ll be tempted to click on\nit. (...) Actually I think I base it a lot on who?s posted it,\nwhether I like the person or not and respect their views.? P3\nIt is further emphasized that stories shared by respected\nfriends were not only more likely to be interesting, but also\nmore likely to be trusted as being true.\n?I suppose they have quite a lot of influence because if\nthey?re somebody that you get on well with and you respect\ntheir views, you kind of expect that they?re not going to be\nposting stuff that?s fake.? P3\nThe third observed behaviour was when participants relied\npurely on their own assessment while either completely\nignoring the source or acknowledging whether or not it was\nreliable and choosing not to take that into account. In these\ninstances, the fact that a source was a reputable newspaper\nor an openly satirical website did little to alter their own\nassessment of the validity of a news story, often made based\non its believability to the participant and given their own\npredispositions. One participant, while trying to judge the\n?Trump?s Health Deteriorates? story shown in Figure 2, went\nclicking on different stories on the same website to determine\nwhat sort of news site it was. The site was of course satirical,\nwhich the participant recognized.\n?(Browsing a satirical news site) Well this is clearly fake\nnews. (...) It?s irrelevant, it?s just a joke. (Clicks on a\ndifferent story on the same site) Yeah again, fake. That?s just\nsilly. (Returns to the Trump story) I mean with this one, it\ncould well be. There?s probably an element, quite a big\nelement of truth in it. It?s difficult to tell. (...) The picture is\npoking fun, I don?t think the article is actually.? P7\nThus, having established that he was browsing a satirical site,\nthe participant decided that one story on it was likely true\nbecause it was believable to him. Notably the story need not\nbe either entirely true or entirely false - here the participant\nrecognized that there may be some false elements to the story\n(an altered photo), but that overall the content was truthful.\nVeracity based on the content\nSome of our participants appeared to pay less attention to the\napparent source of the news stories they were reading as\nappearing on each Facebook post, and instead focused on the\ncontent of the story itself, making no mention of source in\ntheir assessment. They simply described their belief in terms\nof the credibility of the article itself by supporting it with, for\ninstance, their own prior knowledge. A news story about\nhouse prices falling in the UK had already become familiar\nto some participants: ?I know that?s true. Because I?ve read\nthat or a similar article.? P1\nWhen the story was deemed particularly incredible, that was\nsometimes enough to simply dismiss it without the need for\nfurther verification. The story of Camembert cheese no\nlonger being available to British markets was deemed\nobviously untrue: ?It?s not real. It?s definitely not real.? P9\nTo our participants the story was deemed truthful or not\nbased entirely on its own merits. Naturally, funny or\nhumorous content was likely to leave participants doubting\nthe truth of a story. Many participants have gotten used to the\nidea of parody news sites, and to them particularly funny\nheadlines were immediate signs of a fake story.\n?It is funny. That?s the thing. I find if you can instantly laugh\nat a headline of that sort then often my head just goes straight\nto spoof sort of news article.? P4\n?I?ve heard of [the Camembert story] going around. It?s like\nwhen they said Prosecco was running out.? P8\nParticipants however did not always separate humour from\ntruth. Truthful articles did not need to be serious, as one\nparticipant pointed out while reading a spoof article. The\nstory on a nightclub banning music from the film Baywatch\namused the participants, but that did not mean it was fake:\n?It could be real, but I think that the article is written for a\nlaugh.? P9\nThe fact that a story was ?written for a laugh? did not negate\nits validity as a proper news story, and the participant was\nwilling to take some of its content as valid. Our participants\ndid not suggest that they believed there was an absolute link\nbetween the truth and believability of an article. Participants\nlooked for grains of truth in all places and often chose to\naccept parts of a story that they felt happy to believe\nregardless of how incredible or humorous the story was.\nFinally, in addition to the believability of the content, the\nstyle of reporting as well as information about the author and\ndate of an article were sometimes relied on. For example,\nwhen looking at a story from CNN, one participant was not\nsatisfied with the source of a story being reliable, and went\nfurther to investigate the provenance of the article itself:\n?It?s telling me the date of when it was published, it?s got the\nreporter and it?s got a picture of them. (...) Can see whether\nit?s a real reporter, and yeah, it looks legitimate.? P6\nIn addition, informal writing style was seen as a mark of\nfictitious news, regardless of the source. One participant\nacknowledged New York Post as a reliable source, but\ndoubted the story because of its journalistic style:\n?Using words like?legit?; if it is actually the New York Post\nyou would have thought they wouldn?t use that shortened\nslangy speak.? P7\nInterest in ?this kind of news?\nThe participants? apparent level of interest in, or personal\norientation to the news stories showed up often in our\nobservations. Firstly, when a story seemed of little\nsignificance to the user, whether it was true or not became\nirrelevant. Several participants found it difficult to engage\nwith stories that mattered little to them despite repeated\nprompting. When the topic of the story was not seen as\npersonally relevant, there was little interest in figuring out\nwhether or not it was true. One participant paused at the story\nabout actress Zoe Saldana condemning Hollywood?s\ntreatment of Donald Trump, then quickly realized she has no\ninterest in making an assessment either way.\n?Celebrities don?t interest me. [pause] I don?t know what to\nmake of it? P9\nAnother participant paid even less attention to that story and\njust scrolled past it, despite having been given the task of\nworking out which stories are real and which aren?t.\n?[Researcher: I noticed you almost scrolled straight past it.]\nYeah. Straight past it. Doesn?t bother me. I?ve got\nabsolutely no interest in it whatsoever. I don?t really know\nZoe Saldana so it?s not something I?d even entertain more\nthan a second on.? P7\nIn contrast, participants suggested that they were more\nwilling to invest time in finding the truth of something if they\nit has a personal or professional interest to them.\n?It doesn?t really interest me, but saying that someone writes\nan article about wind power releasing more CO2 than\nburning coal then I probably would look that up and\nresearch that more (...) because my interest would be peaked,\nbecause it?s something that I care about.? P7\nThus the level of interest in a story, solely from its Facebook\npost, was a strong indicator of how likely a participant was\nto make a judgement as to its veracity. The reverse was also\ntrue ? the apparent veracity of a news story was often a\ndetermining factor in whether or not a story was interesting.\nParticipants indicated interest in stories that were clearly\nfalse, with some participants deliberately seeking out those\nfake stories in their own Facebook feeds.\n?I tend to be more interested in the stuff that is definitely not\ntrue, like the more kind of The Daily Mash and Newsthump\nand those kinds of articles which are sort of based on facts\nbut are definitely not true if you know what I mean.? P1\nThis in contrast to participants only interested in news that\nthey could rely on, and who had little time for anything else.\n?Doesn?t interest me (?) blatantly not going to be true.? P8\nThe lack of interest in a story that is seen as false was in this\ncase a hindrance: as the story itself was true (a story about\ncows being fed Skittles candy), but the participant did not\ndeem it worthy of investigation because it didn?t seem likely.\nReflections on Fake News\nWhen asked to describe in their own words what they\nunderstood ?fake news? to mean, the responses varied with\nsome defining the term based only on the truthfulness of the\nstory. They described different ways a story might be fake,\nwith the most straightforward being that a fake story was one\nthat is based on something true, but containing falsehoods.\n?It?s based around somebody obviously that?s real but the\nsituation that it?s in is just fake.? P3\nA second group of participants however took the lack of truth\nin the article as being secondary to the definition of fake\nnews, with the primary element being the intent behind it. To\nsome, fake news was written by playful or bored individuals\nwith no intent to cause harm, while others were warier of the\npeople behind fake news and described them at best as\nattempts to appeal to a specific audience.\n?Stuff that people have made up either for a laugh or because\nthey got nothing better to do.? P5\n?To make the story more appealing to whoever they want to\nappeal to.? P1\nAt worst, they were seen as false stories written to shape the\nviews of unsuspecting readers by stirring up opinions or\ninfluencing their decision-making.\n?? made up to influence the way people see things or make\nthem buy or just do something they wouldn?t normally.? P8\nTo several of these participants, fake news seemed a cause\nfor various degrees of concern. There was the obvious\nconcern that fake news may influence people?s opinions.\n?It will influence people?s political decisions or the way they\ngo about their lives.? P9\nOthers worried that fake news will make it more and more\ndifficult to find the truth, especially when appearing\nincidentally alongside the other traffic of a social media feed.\n?probably could be quite detrimental because there are some\nserious issues that need reporting and if you have to trawl\nthrough all the fake news to find the truth, it?s not easy.? P7\nThe incidental delivery of news through social media was\nbelieved to have had an effect on the behaviour of a number\nof our participants, including being aware of not thinking\nabout the truthfulness of a story.\n?Sometimes you might see a video on Facebook and not be\nable to tell if it?s been staged or if it?s real (?) I?d just keep\ngoing and not bother checking if I?m right or not, or, I might\nsee in the comments and look to see if anybody else has\nremarked on whether it?s real or not.? P9\nUltimately, this is believed to have led to the undermining\nthe usefulness of social media as a delivery tool in general.\n?I don't use Facebook as much anymore (?) most of it?s\nfalse or whatever whether it?s like that tower fire, Trump or\nwhatever, it?s all, you get the one sided stuff (?)? P8\nSolutions to Fake News\nWhen asked to reflect on their ability to detect fake news, the\nresult was an overall weak level of confidence. Answers\nshowed varying degrees of uncertainty ranging from\n?Average probably at best? (P7) to ?Pretty good? (P5). As\nsuch we asked them to speculate on a tool that would help\ndetermine whether news being read was fake or real.\nParticipants were in general dubious about the utility of such\na tool. Only one positive response came from a participant\nwho said, ?It would probably be quite good for me.? (P7) For\nothers, they doubted whether such a tool would be of value\nto them. One participant said, ?It?s quite interesting, but I?m\nnot sure,? (P8) whereas another was fairly confident about\nhis own ability to detect fake news, simply stated, ?I don?t\nthink that it will make any difference for me.? (P5) Other\nparticipants were even less keen. Their concerns about such\na tool were determined by whether they saw it using\ncrowdbased verification of news or whether it was authoritative or\nalgorithmic flagging of fake news. In the case of\ncrowdsourced news verification, one participant worried that\nthe crowd might just not be able to separate their own\nopinions from the question of whether news is fake:\n?You could come under this whole issue of actual creditable\nreporting is being branded as fake because someone just\ndoesn?t agree with its opinion.? P6\nParticipants who saw such as a tool as being an authoritative\nfilter had stronger feelings towards it. One questioned how\nthat would even work as only a handful of news items are\nfully verifiable and questions where one would draw the line.\n?A lot of news doesn?t come from reliable sources. (?) Well\nyou couldn?t have any news then that hadn?t come from a\nresearch paper or hadn?t been verified in some way. So then\nit makes all news a little bit un-credible (laughs). I don?t\nknow because where would you draw the line?? P3\nTo others it was doubtful whether they trusted anyone\nenough to delegate that responsibility to.\n?I don?t think so because how do I know? How can I trust the\nperson that?s alerting me?? P1\nDISCUSSION\nIn this section, we examine the implications of our findings\nregarding the behaviour of news consumers on social media,\nbut also the broader implications for producing news in an\nincreasingly dominant social media age.",

Participants\nappeared to initially draw conclusions based on what we may\nterm formal characteristics, such as considering the generally\ndeemed reliability of a source URL, but also criteria that\nwere more substantive insofar as they sought to judge\ncontent per se. A further confounding factor that drives the\nlength to which a participant would take their investigation\nis their level of personal interest in the story itself.\nThe extent to which these factors are drawn upon is also\nvariable. In some instances, conclusions are drawn purely\nfrom the information presented in the Facebook feed, and a\njudgement immediately made solely on headline, indicated\nsource and image, presenting a challenge for those concerned\nwith the rise of so-called ?click-bait?. In others, a judgement\nis made having clicked the article but before making any\nattempt to analyse the content or source in detail. The length\nof this process is primarily driven by reported personal\ninterest ? veracity is seemingly irrelevant regardless as to\nwhether it is clearly satire, exaggeration or in fact true.\nThe apparent, formal, source of an article is an important part\nof the verification process. Lack of knowledge of a source is\nseen as an indicator of fakeness, although can lead to further\nattempts to form an opinion on the general tenor of the source\nbased on layout, writing style and other articles. Notably our\nparticipants took the reported source of the news articles, in\nthis case as presented in the Facebook news feed, at face\nvalue. In this regard, the source was seen as the entity that\nwas either truthful or not, and there was little consideration\nof the fact that the news could be re-reported several times\nfrom multiple sources with different editorial slants. Here\nthere may be opportunities for extending notions of ?source?\ninto a more detailed display of the digital provenance of a\npiece of news, both in terms of media but also social source.\nChallenging Established Hierarchies of Trustworthiness\nOur data raises intriguing issues about what one may term\nestablished, but now increasingly questioned, hierarchies of\nperceived reliability and trustworthiness of publicly\ncirculating information. As a broader issue, this far pre-dates\nrecent concerns and polemical polarizations over ?fake\nnews?. It can indeed be linked to what was described as a\ngrowing ?incredulity? towards long-established\n?metanarratives? and claims or ?regimes? of truth [\n        \n        ]. Lyotard\nidentified such incredulity ? or widening disenchantment\nwith previously taken-for-granted sources of authority and\nknowledge ? as a defining part of The Postmodern\nCondition. Underpinning debates about ?fake news? are\nsimilar contests over what counts as reliable information and\nas to which authorities ? in this case also including the ?social\nnetworks? ? are entrusted with channelling such information.\nSeen in this context, debates around fake news in general,\nand our participants in particular, seem to be aware of and\ngrappling with an ever-widening uncertainty as to what\ncounts or can be presented as trustworthy information. More\nnarrowly, the different sense-making positions employed\npose the following questions for future research: how widely\nadhered to are long-established and at least until recently\nwidely accepted hierarchies of reliable\ninformationproviders (i.e. traditionally associated with the ?quality?,\nbroadsheet press and public broadcasting associations) as\nopposed to more clearly politically positioned or out-rightly\npartisan news-sources (e.g. the tabloid press)? How are such\nhierarchies of perceived trustworthiness variously embraced,\n(re)negotiated, contested or employed as social actors make\nsense of a rapidly growing and accelerating flow of news or\ninformation heading their way? Here also was a distinct lack\nof trust in any proposed introduction of institutional fact\nchecking of news when presented via social media. The\naforementioned ?scoring? of the veracity of news articles\nwould seemingly suffer from a similar uncertainty.\nSome of our participants clearly still uphold hierarchical\ndistinctions between less and more trustworthy sources of\nnews, at times granting them the final authority in deciding\non the perceived reliability of a news item. In other cases,\nsuch hierarchies appear to have lost their former traction\nalmost altogether. And an in-between position appears to see\nindividuals reference such hierarchies strategically: i.e. if it\nserves their rhetorical purposes. These issues appear to be\nexacerbated by the indiscriminate mixing of a multitude of\npieces of information in an ?average? social media feed.\nThe Politics of Social News Consumption\nThe second set of questions emerging from our work pertains\nto what motivates particular social actors to make the\ninevitable selections from the vast amount of constantly\nmultiplying information surrounding all of us and defining\nlife in the information age [\n        \n        ]. This is especially pertinent\ngiven the apparent prevalence of social media usage\nindicated by our survey and study ? if users are indeed\nturning to sites such as Facebook to fulfil their news\nrequirements, then they must inevitably self-select from the\nvariety of articles passing by on a daily basis."

                    "Fake News and Echo Chambers\nOur survey respondents and study participants were all able\nto speak to what they considered to be the type of news they\nconsumed via social media and what they tended to like,\ndislike and value. Where participants had little or no interest\nin the topic at hand, they would not even entertain the story.\nA key concept associated with the fake news debate, the\n?echo chamber?, is purportedly inhabited by growing\nnumbers of ideologically blinkered consumers of news. The\nidea of an echo chamber insinuates that social actors select\nonly those bits of information they consider politically (or\notherwise) palatable, whilst ignoring challenging\ncounterclaims and thereby avoiding engagement with alternative\npositions, interpretations and world-views. There is a\nhistorical question to be asked here, namely if digital echo\nchambers of the early 21st century are any more solidly\n?sealed? from one another and thus inhibiting real public\ndiscussion across political divides, than political camps of\nprevious eras would have been, with their usually separate\nnewspapers, civil society associations etc.",
                    "Our current discussion however is not about whether echo\nchambers are real or new, nor is it about how to address them.\nIndeed, by scrolling past articles that had little relevance to\nthem, our participants showed that even if they were to be\nconfronted with news from outside their bubble, they were\nunlikely to engage with it. This hints at the problem of echo\nchambers being a sociological one that needs to be addressed\nthrough improved public education and media literacy rather\nthan improved algorithms and content filters. Instead we are\ninterested in how fake news might have exacerbated the\neffects of those chambers and what can be done to mitigate\nthat. Fake news that supports a certain narrative often stands\nunchallenged within the echo chamber since evidence of its\nfalsities would not find its way into the bubble.",

Crowdsourced tools that would flag news\nstories as being true or false are susceptible to the same echo\nchamber effect as the news stories themselves, where\nindividuals would reinforce truths that fit their narratives and\nshed doubt on those that do not, regardless of their veracity.\nWe believe that a solution to this issue does not lie in\nproviding users with answers about what?s right and what?s\nwrong, which has been shown to risk simply being ignored\nby users [\n        \n        ], but rather in empowering them to make this\ndecision for themselves with as much support as possible.\nIdeally, a tool to fight fake news would not simply label news\nas trustworthy or not, but would offer the news consumer\nwith links to alternate or perhaps further reading on a story\nthey are currently viewing. Additional context from more\nreliable or authoritative sources may shed light on what parts\nof the story if any are true and what parts are not. This is in\nline with the position that, when it comes to fake news,\ntechnology should augment rather than replace human\njudgement [\n        \n        ].

Instead our discussion is a\nreflection upon detailed accounts of our participants? news\nconsumption strategies. The themes that have emerged\nhighlight the wide variety of methods and resources drawn\nupon to engage in the task even given the limited sample size.\nThe innovative design of our methodology that asked\nparticipants to think aloud while examining a Facebook feed\nsuccessfully elicited reflections on news consumption\npractices, however the explicit nature of the task is inevitably\na step removed from more naturalistic settings. Participants\nwere not browsing their own Facebook account, and instead\nwere given a profile that had been created specifically for the\nexercise. While similar in presentation, this obviously lacked\nthe familiar context provided by an individual?s normal\nsocial media circles. Alongside the challenges of articulating\nthoughts and providing justifications for their behaviours,\nsome participants pointed out that they were used to\nconsuming information on their social media very quickly.\nThe exercise required them to go through the posts to find\nthe fake news, so the nature of the activity meant that\nparticipants appeared to go through the posts at a slower pace\nthan they may normally adopt when browsing their usual\nsocial media. While ?fake news? may be thought of as a\nprimarily US-centric concern our survey results show that\nthe term is also interpreted by our UK respondents as\nspeaking to similar issues of truthfulness and trustworthiness\nof news, and as also highlighted by Reuters [\n        \n        ]. However,\nfuture research is needed to capture and examine\nconsumption and sense-making strategies in wider and more\nnaturalistic settings, ideally through forms of audience\nethnographies tailored to the information age."

                    "CONCLUSION\nThis paper has shown, through an online survey and study,\nthat social media users are aware of and encountering what\ncan be characterised as ?fake news.? A think aloud study has\nsubsequently revealed various interpretative and\nargumentative strategies used by readers when asked to make\njudgements on the truthfulness of news presented in a social\nmedia feed. Our participants? behaviour suggests that they\nassess news differently when it is presented via social media,\nincluding drawing upon a variety of formal and judgement\nbased characteristics, potentially challenging traditionally\nhierarchical information provision, and demonstrating that\nperceived levels of interest in topics is a key factor when\nconsidering solutions to echo chambers and fake news.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to the University of Nottingham Digital\nResearch Strategy Fund for supporting this work.\nPage 9"
