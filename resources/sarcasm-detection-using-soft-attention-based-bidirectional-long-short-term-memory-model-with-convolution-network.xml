        <p>A large community of research has been developed in recent years to analyze social media and social networks, with the aim of understanding, discovering insights, and exploiting the available information. The focus has shifted from conventional polarity classi cation to contemporary applicationoriented ne-grained aspects such as, emotions, sarcasm, stance, rumor, and hate speech detection in the user-generated content. Detecting a sarcastic tone in natural language hinders the performance of sentiment analysis tasks. The majority of the studies on automatic sarcasm detection emphasize on the use of lexical, syntactic, or pragmatic features that are often unequivocally expressed through gurative literary devices such as words, emoticons, and exclamation marks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model called sAtt-BLSTM convNet that is based on the hybrid of soft attention-based bidirectional long shortterm memory (sAtt-BLSTM) and convolution neural network (convNet) applying global vectors for word representation (GLoVe) for building semantic word embeddings. In addition to the feature maps generated by the sAtt-BLSTM, punctuation-based auxiliary features are also merged into the convNet. The robustness of the proposed model is investigated using balanced (tweets from benchmark SemEval 2015 Task 11) and unbalanced (approximately 40000 random tweets using the Sarcasm Detector tool with 15000 sarcastic and 25000 non-sarcastic messages) datasets. An experimental study using the training- and test-set accuracy metrics is performed to compare the proposed deep neural model with convNet, LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM with/without attention and it is observed that the novel sAtt-BLSTM convNet model outperforms others with a superior sarcasm-classi cation accuracy of 97.87% for the Twitter dataset and 93.71% for the random-tweet dataset.</p>

      <p>I. INTRODUCTION
The biggest challenge in sentiment analysis tasks is to
accurately determine the veracity of the statement in literal
sense so as to classify text on the basis of polarity
(positive or negative). Sentiment analysis achieves decent results
in the case of literal language as it conveys the expected
interpretation. However, the use of gurative language that
is inherently emblematic represents something other than the
concrete meaning, thereby making sentiment analysis a

trivial problem. ``Sarcasm is de ned as a speci c type of
sentiment where people express their negative feelings using
positive or intensi ed positive words in the text'' [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. It is
a rhetoric narrative that presents a communicatively
significant discord between the actual situation and the utterance
content. For example, a tweet/post, ``It is wonderful feeling
to waste hours in traf c jams!'' clearly indicates this
discord between the actual situation of ``being stuck in traf c
jam'' and the utterance content ``wonderful.'' This contrast
and shift of sentiments in sarcastic expressions validates
sarcasm as a special instance of sentiment analysis.
Therefore, the detection of sarcastic expressions will enhance

the automatic sentiment analysis of huge and diverse social
web data.</p>
      <p>
        Automatic sarcasm detection is typically a
textclassi cation problem, which relies on a variety of
featureextraction and learning techniques. In general, the Twitter
post size characterizes short text with a character limit of 280,
which is insuf cient in providing the desired word
cooccurrence data. This data sparseness is challenging for
conventional learning models based on statistical features, such
as term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or
co-occurrence. Deep learning architectures have proven
capabilities when dealing with natural language, as they can learn
by example, offer a exible set of modeling alternatives while
curtailing feature engineering, scale up to big data, exploit
unlabeled data to detect trends and identify patterns too
complex for humans to notice, and be used for multitask
learning [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. The primary contribution of this work includes:
Improving the performance of the sentiment
analysis task by building, training and evaluating a deep
learning model, sAtt-BLSTM convNet, a hybrid of
soft attention-based bidirectional long short-term
memory (sAtt-BLSTM) and convolution neural network
(convNet)
Feature engineering for automatic sarcasm detection
using gurative literary devices such as words,
emoticons, and exclamation marks.
      </p>
      <p>Performance benchmarking by testing different kinds of
models and datasets for sarcastic tone classi cation in
real-time.</p>
      <p>The proposed deep learning model, sAtt-BLSTM convNet,
has eight layers:</p>
      <p>Input Layer: The input tweet to the model.</p>
      <p>Embedding Layer: Each word within tweet is mapped
into a low dimension vector using GloVe. This look-up
encodes the input into real-valued vectors called
embedding vectors.</p>
      <p>BLSTM layer: The output of the word-embedding layer
is fed into the BLSTM layer. The purpose of this layer
is to learn high-level features from the previous step.</p>
      <p>Attention Layer: Asoft attention mechanism (based on
softmax) is used, which generates semantic context
vectors. These are merged with the BLSTM output features
and auxiliary features to train the convNet.</p>
      <p>Convolution Layer: The convolution operation is
performed to obtain a convolved feature vector.</p>
      <p>Activation Layer: A Recti ed Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation function is applied on the feature vectors (output
of convNet layer).</p>
      <p>Down-sampling Layer: The max-pooling operation is
used as a down-sampling strategy in convNets.</p>
      <p>Representation Layer: A fully connected layer that
consists of a linear transformation layer and softmax
activation function to generate the output predictions.</p>
      <p>
        To build word embeddings, GloVe [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ], which generates
a word vector table, is used. GloVe is a count-based model
of representing words by feature vectors. This model maps
all the tokenized words in each tweet to its respective word
vector table. Proper padding is performed to unify the
feature vector matrix. This matrix is given as an input to the
bidirectional long-short-term-memory (BLSTM) layer. The
BLSTM networks set up an additional layer to the
unidirectional LSTM networks, where the hidden-to-hidden
connections ow in opposite temporal order. The network thus
exploits information from the past and the future. The output
vector representation from the BLSTM is transformed into an
attention-weighted sum of these output vectors. This
wordlevel attention hypothesis relies on valuable words within
text that contribute to the meaning in context, and thus
computes attention probabilities over the input stimuli from the
BLSTM. Consequently, the output feature representations
from BLSTM are concatenated together as the output of
the attention layer, which, combined with auxiliary features,
is provided as input to the convNet. The convNet consists of
multiple lters with a variable-size window connected to a
small part of the input to generate a convolved feature map.
      </p>
      <p>Several lters are used to extract features in a convolution
layer and each lter gives an activation map. The next layer is
the activation layer, or the ReLU layer, which introduces
nonlinearity to the network and generates a recti ed feature map.
This recti ed feature map is fed to the pooling layer to reduce
the dimensionality of the feature map. A k-max pooling
operation is employed, which selects the top k features with
respect to the various hidden layers and generates a pooled
feature map. This pooled feature map is input to the fully
connected softmax layer, which calculates the probability of
any output word and classi es the tweet as sarcastic or
nonsarcastic.</p>
      <p>Basic sentiment analysis tools have dif culty
distinguishing between positive and negative statements,
especially when sarcasm, irony, and mixed feelings
are included discretely or in combination. Practical
models to predict sarcastic text are thus imperative,
and the proposed model combines semantics from the
attention-based bidirectional LSTM network with
auxiliary pragmatic features to a deep convolution network
for enhanced prediction performance.</p>
      <p>The multiple layers involve nonlinearity that aids
learning complex representations.</p>
      <p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
brie y discusses the pertinent work within the domain of
sentiment analysis and deep learning based automatic sarcasm
detection followed by Section 3, which illustrates the
proposed sAtt-BLSTM convNet model and its working details.
Section 4 explicates the results and provides an analysis of
the same. The nal section, Section 5, concludes the study
and expounds upon the scope of future work.</p>

        II. RELATED WORK
The growing pursuit of Internet users in all forms of social
media has intensi ed researchers' interest to intelligently
mine the content available, both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Twitter, currently the most famous micro-blog,
connects people across the globe and has a high level of user
involvement. It has gradually emerged as a huge source of
sentiment-rich data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]. The keyword ``sentiment analysis''
was initially witnessed in the published work [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ] in 2003,
and since then, both primary [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ] and secondary
studies have been reported across pertinent literature [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ] [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ].
Furthermore, the literature is well-equipped with studies
pertaining to sentiment analysis using machine learning
paradigms on speci cally textual user-generated online
content on social media. Alou and El Saddik [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ] proposed a
model for sentiment analysis of football speci c tweets using
three classi ers, namely, support vector machine,
multinomial Navies Bayes and random forest. Pai and Liu [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ] put
forward a model for prediction of vehicle sales by sentiment
analysis of twitter data and stock market values using least
squares support vector regression. Research using deep
learning models for sentiment analysis has also been reported.
Tseng et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ] analyzed textual opinions found in teaching
evaluation questionnaires and applied the analysis results to
assisting the selection of outstanding teaching faculty
members using attention-based LSTM. Wu and Chi [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ] proposed
a model having quadratic connections of LSTM capable
of capturing complex semantic representations of natural
language texts and evaluated on the benchmark dataset,
the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. Bouazizi and Ohtsuki [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]
extended the concept of binary or ternary classi cation
and proposed an approach to classify text collected from
Twitter into seven sentiment classes. The authors further
proposed [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ] multi-class sentiment analysis which addresses
the identi cation of the exact sentiment conveyed by the
user using the task of quanti cation that identi es all the
existing sentiments within a tweet instead of attributing a
single sentiment label to it. Zhang et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ] proposed a
model combining convolution neural network and
bidirectional gated recurrent unit for sentence semantic classi
cation. Han et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ] used CNN and BLSTM to design
four kinds of memory network models for text sentiment
classi cation. Fu et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ] proposed a lexicon-enhanced
LSTM model that uses sentiment lexicon as extra information
pre-training a word sentiment classi er. Wang et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ]
proposed a sophisticated algorithm based on deep learning
and information geometry for sentiment classi cation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signi cant studies exemplify sarcasm as a contradiction in
polarity [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ]. Sarcasm detection has been reported as a
non-trivial challenge for sentiment analysis across literature
studies. There have been expansive efforts by researchers to
investigate sarcasm-detection techniques on various social
media channels as a sub-task of sentiment analysis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ].
Bouazizi and Ohtsuki [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        ] propose a pattern-based approach
to detect sarcasm on Twitter considering four sets of features
that cover the different types of sarcasms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Architectures based on deep learning techniques have
gained popularity in natural language programming
applications as they are capable of handling data sparseness
in unbalanced datasets. Studies on bullying and verbal
aggression have been reported deep neural network for
short-text sentiment analysis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ]. A few such approaches
have been reported for automatic sarcasm detection as well.
Felbo et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ] proposed a DeepMoji model, which is based
on the occurrences of emoji, for detecting the emotional
content on Twitter. It uses a variant of LSTM, a 6-layer model
that is a hybrid of BLSTM and the attention mechanism for
the detection of sarcastic tweets. A new convolution
networkbased architecture is presented in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
        ] that learn user
embeddings in addition to utterance-based embeddings, which
allows the authors to learn user-speci c context. The
similarity between word embeddings is used by Joshi et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
        ]
as features for sarcasm detection. The authors have
concatenated features from previous works to these word
embeddingbased features. Ghosh and Veale [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
        ] have built a model
combining a convNet with a recurrent neural network (RNN,
long short-term memory) followed by a deep neural network.
It is observed that this approach shows an improvement for
the deep learning architecture when compared with
recursive SVM. In [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
        ], models based on a pre-trained convNet
have been developed that are used to extract emotion,
sentiment, and even personality features for sarcasm detection.
In another study, [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
        ], bidirectional LSTM is used to
capture syntactic and semantic information over tweets, along
with a pooling neural network to extract contextual features
automatically from history tweets. Performance using neural
features is compared with discrete manual features and an
improvement is observed. Attention mechanism has been
previously used by researchers in the domain of natural language
understanding as it selectively focuses on information-rich
phrases within the sequence of sentence. Recently, authors
Seo et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
        ] and Wang et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
        ] demonstrated the effective
use of attention for compression and question-answering.
III. AUTOMATED SARCASM DETECTION
The proposed framework for automatic sarcasm detection has
four key components, namely, (A) data acquisition, (B)
preprocessing, (C) implementation of the sAtt-BLSTM
convNet model, and (D) evaluation using performance measures.
These are explained in detail in the following subsections.
A. DATASET ACQUISITION
To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the
following datasets have been used for empirical analysis. The
purpose of using two varied datasets was to further validate
the results achieved and determine the robustness of the
selected features and the model trained on these features.
1) BALANCED DATASET: SEMEVAL 2015 TASK 11
The original SemEval dataset consists of 20000
hashtagannotated tweets, which were created for the Twitter
sentiment analysis task. SemEval 2015 task 11 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
        ] de ned the
challenge as a ``dataset for sentiment analysis of gurative
language on Twitter.'' The objective of the task is speci cally
to evaluate the use of gurative language, where the word
or phrase described as `` gurative'' meant that it is being
used in a way that was symbolic and represented something
other than its concrete meaning. Although gurative language
encompasses an extensive variety of literary tools and
techniques, such as similes, emoticons, metaphor, personi
cation, idiom, and hyperbole, this benchmark dataset contains
tweets with speci c gurative types, namely, sarcasm, irony,
and metaphor. The sarcasm corpus is thus constructed by
collecting self-annotated tweets with the hashtags #irony,
#sarcasm, and #not. Although there is a subtle difference
between the three, we consider all of them in the same
category for performing this empirical analysis. Thus, this
study is also indicative of how this generalization in uences
the obtained results. The experiments used the SemEval 2013
task 2 dataset as the negative class data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
        ]. Manual perusal
of the two datasets revealed that both contain tweets from
general topics, thus avoiding any bias in our experimentation.
To collect data for the experiments, we tried to retrieve
15961 tweets using a list of the dataset's tweet ids provided,
out of which 7994 are sarcastic and 7324 are non-sarcastic.
2) IMBLANCED DATASET: RANDOM TWEETS
In real time, the presence of sarcasm in tweets is less frequent.
A randomly sampled dataset containing 15,000 sarcastic
and 25,000 non-sarcastic tweets is built using the Sarcasm
Detector tool.1
B. PRE-PROCESSING
After the data acquisition, to intelligently mine the text,
the tweets are pre-processed to clean and transform the
data for feature extraction [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
        ]. These include the following
processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        URLs, mentions, hashtags, and numbers in the tweets
are replaced with placeholders
All tweets are tokenized by the Natural Language
Toolkit (NLTK) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
        ]
All tokens are sampled in lowercase
All tweets are stemmed to the root word using Porter's
Stemmer [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
        ]
All non-ASCII-English characters were removed,
to limit the domain of data to the English language
All words are replaced by pre-trained GloVe word
vectors. Words that do not exist in the pre-trained
embeddings are set to a zero vector
Several auxiliary features are used to enhance the
classication model. These are primarily pragmatic markers
concerned with language use. We consider the following ve
punctuation-based features that help understand the subtleties
of sarcasm in text, as these indicate gurative text and
symbolic clues within the text:
      </p>
      <p>Number of exclamation marks (!) in the tweet

C. THE PROPOSED sATT-BLSTM CONVNET MODEL
The proposed deep learning model uses 8 layers: the input
layer, embedding layer, BLSTM layer, attention layer,
convolution layer, activation and ReLU layer, max pooling layer,
and representation layer. Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of
the proposed multi-layer model. The details of each layer are
provided in the subsequent subsections.
1) INPUT LAYER
The tweets after pre-processing are fed to the input layer. The
input layer is connected to the embedding layer, which builds
word embeddings using GloVe.
2) EMBEDDING LAYER
The embedding layer maps the input into real-valued vectors
using encoding from look-up tables. Word embeddings
facilitate learned word representations. The bene ts of extracting
features based on word embedding to detect sarcasm have
been recently reported [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
        ]. In this study, to build word
embeddings, GloVe, which generates a word vector table,
is used. GloVe is a count-based model of representing words
by feature vectors. This log-bilinear model studies the
relationship of words by counting the number of times they
co-occur. Thus, this model aids in mapping all the tokenized
words in each tweet to their respective word vector tables.
Proper padding is performed to unify the feature vector
matrix. That is, if the total number of given tweets is Z and
there is a tweet X with t tokens, generation of a word vector
Table 5 with dimension d of the word vectors is completed
using GloVe. Thus, for all Z, each t in X is mapped to its
respective V. After this mapping, each X is expressed as
a vector of the word embeddings concatenation (E). Thus,
the feature vector matrix is obtained as shown in (1).
      </p>
      <p>
        F D U C B C T C P C E;
(1)
where C is the concatenation operator of the vector. The
tweets are of varying length, so to unify the feature vector
matrix representation of tweets, the tweets with the maximum
length in the given corpus are used as a threshold value. This
is done basically to x the length of the tweet matrix. Hence,
for all the tweets that were shorter than this threshold, zero
padding was performed. This matrix was nally fed as input
(i.e., F) to the BLSTM layer.
3) BLSTM LAYER
LSTM is an RNN that contains special units in the recurrent
hidden layer called memory blocks [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
        ]. Self-connections
exist within the memory cells. There is an input, output, and
forget gate for each memory cell. The hidden layer of LSTM
is also called the LSTM cell. LSTM has the capability to plot
long-term dependencies by de ning each memory cell with
a set of gates &lt;d , where d is the memory dimension of the
hidden state of LSTM [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
        ]. At each iteration t, the LSTM cell
has the layer input xt and the layer output ht . LSTM contains
three gates, which are functions of the current input xt and
hidden state ht 1: input gate it, forget gate ft, and output gate
ot. The cell also takes the cell input state st , the cell output
state ct , and the previous cell output state ct 1 into account
while training and updating parameters.
      </p>
      <p>The input gate, forget gate, output gate, and input cell state
can be calculated using equations (2) (7).</p>

      <p>
        The bidirectional LSTM connects two hidden layers to a
single output layer. The forward-layer output sequence h!
is iteratively calculated using inputs in a positive sequence
from time t-n to time t-1, while the backward-layer output
sequence, h$ is calculated using the reversed inputs from
time t-n to t-1 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
        ]. Both the forward- and backward-layer
outputs are calculated by using the standard LSTM updating
equations. This creates two copies of the hidden layer, one t
in the input sequences as is and one as a reversed copy of the
input sequence [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
        ]. These representations are concatenated
together using the attention mechanism. That is, the BLSTM
layer generates an output vector in which each element is
calculated by using (9).

salient words from both directions as possible. Thus, similar
to that of the LSTM layer, the nal output of the BLSTM
layer can be represented by a vector (10).</p>
      <p>
        YtD [yt n; :::::::;yt 1]
4) ATTENTION LAYER
The idea of attention [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
        ] has originated by the observation
that each word contributes to the meaning of tweet (sentence)
differently that is; all words do not contribute equally to the
representation of the sentence meaning. The users reading
text can intuitively identify important, meaningful parts of the
sentence. The attention mechanism adds an additional
structure to the network, which is learned as part of the standard
model training via back-propagation. A deterministic,
differentiable attention mechanism, known as soft attention [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
        ],
is used, where the weights on each location are usually given
by a softmax, and the output of the attention module is a
weighted sum of representations at each location. This whole
process can be described by a differentiable function, so that
training can be performed jointly with the rest of the network
using back-propagation.
      </p>
      <p>We use a word-level attention mechanism to focus on
the words that have a closer semantic relationship to the
sentence meaning. That is, the word-level attention is applied
to the feature representations of BLSTM. The output is thus a
weighted combination of all the input states, not just the last
state. The attention mechanism gives an attention score ei;t to
each word t in the sentence i, as given by (11).</p>
      <p>ei;t D g(Wht c);
where g is an activation function.

      <title>Auxilary Features</title>
      <p>
        Pragmatic features, such as punctuation or repetition of
words, aid in understanding the subtleties of sarcasm in text,
as these indicate gurative text and symbolic clues within the
text. Punctuation is considered ideal for the representation of
syntactic features, as the punctuation features contribute to a
substantial boost in classi cation quality [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
        ]. These can be
exempli ed by the use of exclamation points/marks, repeated
letters (especially vowels), or uppercase letters (ALL CAPS)
in textual messages such as tweets/posts. A few examples
where these punctuation features impact the emotion quotient
in text are given below:
â An exclamation point or exclamation mark (!) intensi es
the emotional content preserving the semantic
orientation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
        ]. For example: ``The location is great!!!!'' is
more intense than ``The location is great.''
â Repeated letters (especially vowels) added to elongate
the spelling of a word (e.g., ``haaaaaaapppyyy'') is used
to emphasize the word or to express enthusiasm in
computer-mediated communication [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
        ].
â Capitalization, such as explicitly using ALL CAPS
to emphasize a sentiment-relevant word with other
non-capitalized words in the document, increases the
intensity of the sentiment preserving semantic
orientation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
        ]. For example, ``Simply LOVED the place!'' is
more intense than ``Simply loved the place!''
      </p>
      <p>Thus, sarcasm detection can be made easy by observing the
syntactic pattern of tweet to identify punctuation such as:
â Number of contiguous question marks, exclamation
points, and combinations thereof
â Whether the last token contains a question mark or
exclamation point
â Occurrence of punctuation sequences such
as ``!!!'' and ``?!''</p>
      <p>In this study, the set of punctuation-based features shown
in Table1 are extracted for each tweet.
5) CONVOLUTION LAYER
ConvNet has two primary parts, namely, feature learning
(Conv, ReLU, and Pool) and classi cation (fully connected
and softmax). The output features of the sAtt BLSTM are
combined with auxiliary features and provided as input to
the convNet. Each convolving lter has a variable window
size (s), height, and width. This window slides over to the
input matrix and calculates localized feature vector (vj) for
each possible word (window size) using a nonlinear activation
function (f) and a bias (ba).</p>
      <p>A transition matrix (T) is generated for each lter. This
lter comprises of a layer of weights (weight matrix, W) that
are applied to parts of the input matrix to obtain a single unit
as the output. This is performed for the bias and weight during
the network-learning adjustment, as illustrated in (13).
(13)
(14)
vjD f T:FjVjCs 1Cba</p>
      <p>Here, FjVjCs 1shows the local vector from position j to
j C s 1 in F. Hence, formation of this vj together with
the completion of the convolution operation generates a new
vector, n, as in (14).</p>
      <p>n D [v1; v2; v3; : : : :; vd sC1]</p>
      <p>
        After the sliding operation, the output from each part is
then combined in order to obtain the resultant output, called
the transformed feature map, that serves as the input to the
next layer: the ReLU Layer.
6) RELU LAYER
The activation or ReLU Layer [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
        ] is applied for dealing with
the nonlinearity in the convNet model. It generates a recti ed
feature map, which is fed to the pooling layer to reduce the
dimensionality of the feature map.
7) POOLING LAYER
In this work, max pooling [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>
        ] is used, which takes the
largest element from the recti ed feature map. It reduces
the dimensionality of the feature map and helps retain the
most signi cant features. The k-max pooling operation (p) is
performed for feature selection that chooses the top k features
conforming to various hidden layers, where p is expressed
as (15).
      </p>
      <p>p D max fv1;v2; v3; : : : :;vd sC1g
(15)
8) REPRESNTATION LAYER
The output layer is a fully connected layer that consists of
the softmax activation function. The pooled feature map is
input to the fully connected softmax layer, which calculates
the probability of any output word and classi es the tweet as
sarcastic or non-sarcastic as an output. The output vector of
the softmax layer (O(z)) is as (16).</p>
      <p>O(z)DT(z)O(z 1)Cb(az);

where</p>
      <p>O(z 1) denotes the output vector the pooling layer
T (z) is the transition matrix
b(az) represents the bias factor of softmax layer.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, using a fully connected softmax layer yields the
probability-distribution [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
        ] of the sarcasm detection (Pd),
which is denoted using (17).

D. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
For discussing the results, the empirical analysis has been
broadly divided into two parts: (i) parameter setting for the
proposed model and (ii) comparison with multiple baselines
on the basis of classi cation accuracy.
1) PARAMETER SETTING
Optimal selection of parameters is imperative to achieve
superlative performance results. We use the validation data
to tune the hyper-parameters so as to obtain the best results.
Table 2 lists the values used in this work.</p>
      <p>
        The weights of the network are randomly initialized from
a Gaussian distribution with variance scaled to 0.01, and the
biases are initialized to zero except the forget-gate bias, which
is initialized to 1.
2) PERFORMANCE RESULT
The proposed model is evaluated to predict sarcasm in
tweets using two datasets, namely SemEval 2015 task 11 and
random tweets containing a total of 40,000 tweets. The
results have been assessed using key performance indicators
(accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49 ref50">49, 50</xref>
        ]).
Table 3 lists the results of the proposed sAtt-BLSTM convNet
model implemented on the two datasets and Fig. 2 depicts the
results graphically.
3) COMPARISON WITH BASELINE DEEP LEARNING
MODELS RESULT
We compare the results of the proposed model with three
other deep learning architectures, namely, LSTM, BLSTM
without attention, and convNet. The word embedding was
performed using GloVe for each baseline model and the
evaluation was made for both datasets using the four key
performance indicators. The results obtained for LSTM, BLSTM
without attention, BLSTM with attention and convNet are
shown in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be clearly observed that the proposed sAtt- BLSTM
convNet outperforms the other models with an accuracy
of 91.60% achieved for the SemEval dataset and 88.28% for
random tweets. LSTM shows the least accuracy of 84.89%
and 79.75% for the SemEval and random tweet datasets,
respectively. The models, in order from lowest to highest
accuracy, are LSTM &lt; BLSTM without Attention &lt; BLSTM
with Attention &lt; convNet &lt; sAtt-BLSTM convNet. The best
recall is also observed for the proposed sAtt-BLSTM convNet
for both the datasets. However, the convNet model
demonstrates the best precision value of 92.19% for the SemEval
dataset, whereas the proposed sAtt-BLSTM convNet model
shows the best precision for the random tweets. Table 8
summarizes the comparison of the accuracy results obtained by
the above ve models. Fig. 3 graphically illustrates these
comparative results.
Social media is an informal means of communication that
includes considerable use of slang, malformed words, short
forms, colloquial expressions, mash-up words, etc. All these
amplify the ambiguity, vagueness, and imprecision in the
available social web content and makes the task of
analyzing generic and speci c sentiment computationally dif cult.
Sarcasm is a speci c type of sentiment and its automatic
detection is a dynamic area of research. In this work, we
proposed sAtt-BLSTM convNet, a hybrid of soft attention-based
bidirectional long short-term memory (sAtt-BLSTM) and
convolution neural network (convNet), to detect sarcasm in
short text (tweets). Semantic word embeddings and pragmatic
auxiliary features were used to train the network. The
proposed model demonstrates the highest classi cation accuracy
for both the datasets as compared to the baseline models. The
use of mash-up languages and novelty in vocabulary with
advanced architectures [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>
        ] [81] add to the challenges of
automated detection of sarcasm and characterize some open
problems for future research within the domain.
