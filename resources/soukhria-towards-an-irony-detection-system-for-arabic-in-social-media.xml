        <title>As shown in the previous examples, in social media such as Twitter, users tend to utilize specific hashtags (#irony,</title>
        <p>#sarcasm, #sarcastic) to help readers understand that their message is ironic. These hashtags are often used as gold
labels to detect irony in a supervised learning setting (i.e., learning whether a text span is ironic/sarcastic or not). In
doing so, systems are not able to detect irony without explicit hashtags, but on the positive side, it provides researchers

the task and the lack of freely dedicated tools to process Arabic social media, we propose as a first step to detect irony
relying on features that do not require any preprocessing step such as morpho-syntactic parsing. Our aim is three
folds: (1) Test whether state of the art features whose efficiency have been empirically proved in other languages such
as French, English, Italian, Dutch and Japanese, are also valid for Arabic, (2) Find among these features, the most
productive ones, and (3) Analyze main source of errors.

      <title>2. Irony in Arabic texts</title>
      <p>
        In the standard pragmatic model [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ], irony is viewed as an apparent violation of the maxim of quality, stating that
the speaker does not say what he believes to be false. In this model, when one ironically utters P, one conversationally
implicates its opposite, that is Not(P). This vision has been criticized by several authors who pointed out that logical
opposition between what is said and what is intended captures only one type of irony. To overcome this deficiency,
different theories have been proposed to deal with the multi-dimensional nature of opposition. Among them, we
cite [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref18 ref31 ref35 ref9">1, 9, 18, 31, 35</xref>
        ] that respectively describe irony in terms of echoic mention, allusional pretense, predicate and
propositional negations, relevant inappropriateness, and implicit display.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>These theoretical models have been used as a basis to automatically detect irony and sarcasm in texts. As far as we</title>
        <p>know, no work has investigated irony detection in Arabic social media. As we aim to test whether irony markers used
in irony detection in other languages (such as English) also work for Arabic, we focus in the remaining of this section</p>

          ] proposed a model for the analysis and translation of irony in political commentary
texts from English into Arabic. This model, which relies on the presence of three groups of ironic devices in both
languages (see below), shows that Arabic and English texts share several similarities in the rhetorical, grammmatical
and lexical use of devices, text strategies and rhetorical meaning. However, the differences are, as expected, striking
at the textual realisation level. The devices are as follows:
? lexical devices: synonymy and near synonymy (as in (3) with the use of our souls and inner-selves), metonymy,
binomials2, compound words, lexical choice and idiomatic expression.

extracted from books, articles, the internet and everyday situations. Four main conclusions resulted from the analysis
of the data: (1) Irony is a universal phenomenon since it has been examined in English and Arabic as an example for
its universality; (2) In most cases, ironic expressions are similar to each other in both languages, the differences fall
in the usage of some utterances that are exclusively related to a certain culture whether English or Arabic; (3) Ironic
expressions in Arabic are more figurative than those in English, and finally (4) Opposition, humour and exaggeration
are the most common devices to form ironic expressions in both languages.

like ?? ??? (Hillary), ? (Trump), ???¡? (Al-sissi), ¢ (Moubarak) and ??? ? (Morsi)) which were the subject
of the US and Egyptian presidential elections. The politicians? names are used as keywords to collect the tweets.
Then, we selected ironic tweets containing the topic keywords and the ??   #, ??£ #,  ¤#, ? ? # (translation of
#irony and #sarcasm). We also selected non ironic tweets that contained only the keywords. We removed duplicates,
retweets and tweets containing pictures which would need to be interpreted to understand the ironic content. Arabic
irony hashtags ( ??   #, ??£ #,  ¤#, ? ? #) are removed from the tweets for the following experiments.</p>

and dialectal Arabic (most cases). Since Twitter does not distinguish between standard Arabic, dialectal Arabic and
different dialects, we obtained a corpus of tweets that mixes many dialects, most of which are written in Egyptian,
Syrian and Saudi dialect. Other dialects have been rarely used such as the Tunisian and Algerian dialects. The corpus

          ]. We made this choice to test the performance of related work features
for the Arabic language and to verify whether some features are language independent. The features are as follows:
(1) Surface features : These are the typical surface features that can be irony markers. For example, the presence
of opposing words in a tweet may express an incongruity between two propositions according to irony definition [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>

? opposition words such as (but) and (although) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>

? discourse connectives that do not convey opposition [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ], since we assume that non ironic tweets are likely to
be more verbose. To implement this feature, we used a lexicon of 416 Arabic discourse connectives [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>

as (in addition), (so), etc.
? interjections [

          ]. In Arabic ironic tweets, we noticed that interjections that express laugh such as

          The last two lexicons [

          ] were exploited in the 7th task of the SemEval?2016 campaign on determining sentiment
intensity of English and Arabic phrases 5. Among these four lexicons, the best results were achieved by combining
the last two which resulted in a lexicon of 22,239 negative words and 26,777 positive words after removing
4 The lexicons are available at http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/ArabicSA.html
5 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task7/
duplicates. This was expected as the first two lexicons were extracted from review style data while the two others
were automatically collected from Twitter. In addition, for the same entry, these lexicons provide morphological
variations (e.g. , , and which means bad) as well as dialect variations (e.g. , , , ,

        <p>which means excellent). This is important since we do not rely on any
(3) Shifter features: They allow to detect the following phenomena:
? False assertion: It indicates that a proposition, fact or an assertion fails to make sense against the reality, as in
an example (6) where the assertion (  ­ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?does not contradicts the law of God?) is
not true. We focus in particular on false assertions that are trigged by negation words like ? (no),
To extract this feature, we used a negation word lexicon (15 entries) built manually.

using intensifier such as ¤?? (very), ¥ (too) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref3">3, 23</xref>
          ]. We used an intensifier lexicon (25 entries) translated
from a set of intensifiers used for the French language [

? Reported speech: We hypothesize that ironic tweets are more likely to contain repeated statements said by
?
someone else using reporting speech verbs such as ? ? (say), ?¨? (announce), etc. (cf. tweet (8)) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>

(4) Contextual features. The utterance context is important to understand the ironic meaning of a statement. These

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-13">
        <title>We trained the classifier with a balanced corpus of 1,733 ironic tweets and 1,733 non-ironic tweets. Since the size</title>
        <p>of the corpus is limited, we opted for two experiments: (1) A train/test configuration where we used 80% of the corpus
for training and 20% for testing with an equal distribution between ironic (IR) and non ironic (NIR) instances; (2)</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-14">
        <title>A 10-cross validation configuration on a balanced subset. In both configurations, all surface features were used as baseline.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-15">
        <title>We first wanted to test the performance of each group of features. We have therefore built four Random Forest models, each one with a dedicated group of features. Table 1 gives the results. When testing using a 10-cross validation, the best groups in terms of accuracy are sentiment features (57.15%) and contextual features (65.37%). However, the features groups taken separately are not sufficient to classify the NIR and IR tweets.</title>

        <title>In the second experiment, we tested the performance of Random Forest when trained using all groups of features.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-17">
        <title>The results presented in Table 2 show that our approach outperforms the baseline in both configurations. In particular, 10-Cross validation achieves the best results when using the four groups of features with an Accuracy = 72.36% and F-score = 72.70% for the ironic class and 72.10% for the non-ironic class.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-18">
        <title>In order to improve these results, we applied the GainRatio algorithm for features selection under the Weka toolkit.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-19">
        <title>It allows to have the descending order of the most relevant features which will give the combination of the best features</title>
        <p>by considering their individual predictive capacity with the degree of redundancy between them. The GainRatio
algorithm gave the combination of the following features: Number of emoticons, number of laugh, number of named
entities, presence of exclamation marks, presence negation words, presence of named entities. However, when we run
the classifier with this combination, the results did not improve.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-20">
        <title>Therefore, we tested another approach by learning the Random Forest classifier by adding features one by one</title>
        <p>(following the order given by the selection algorithms) in order to identify the most discriminant features and to have
the features subset that maximizes the classifier performance. The results, presented in Table 3, show that the use
of all features except reporting speech verbs slightly improves the classification task by 1.06% in terms of accuracy
(Accuracy = 72.76% and F-score = 73% for the ironic class and 72.50% for the non-ironic class).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-21">
        <title>To conclude, although we have used a set of features most of which are surface features, the results for Arabic</title>
        <p>tweet classifications in ironic/non-ironic are very encouraging in comparison to those obtained for other languages.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-22">
        <title>For ironic class, we obtained a precision of 72.4%, while for the French language, the precision is 93% [20], 30% for</title>

        <sec id="sec-4-23-1">
          <title>4.3. Error analysis</title>
          <p>An error analysis shows that classification errors are mainly due to two factors:
? Absence of context: This is the main cause of errors. Indeed, interpretation of misclassified tweets requires
external contextual knowledge to tweets. For example, in (10), the reader has to know that the Egyptian President
bought weapons and that he was accused to use them againts his people (according to the author?s view, money
belongs to the people).
(10)
#</p>
          <p>(With Sissy bullets and our money Oh my brother #irony)
? Wrong pre-annotation: The absence (presence) of #irony or #sarcasm in tweets containing ironic (non ironic)
utterances, as the ironic tweet in (11) and the non ironic tweet in (12). These cases are a minority (around 3%)
as it is for other languages like French and English where irony hashtags have been shown to be quite reliable
as good inter-annotator agreements (kappa around 0.75) between annotators irony label and the reference irony
hashtags have been reported (Karoui et al., 2015). We plan to fully analyze those cases in the future so that
wrong pre-annotations will be corrected before making the corpus available.

        <title>For the first time, this paper proposed an approach to irony detection in a corpus of Arabic tweets. Our approach is</title>
        <p>supervised and rely on a group of four features, that have been used for detecting irony in other languages (English,</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-25">
        <title>French, Dutch and Japanese). We evaluate the performance of each group (among surface, sentiment, shifter and contextual features) and conclude that all features were important for our task. We achieved an accuracy of 72.36% which is good given the difficulty of processing Arabic social media texts and the lack of dedicated tools to deal with code switching.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-26">
        <title>This study is a first step towards an Arabic irony detection system. In the future, we plan to manually check the</title>
        <p>reliability of hashtags and include pragmatic features that help to infer the context needed to understand ironic reading.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-27">
        <title>For example, recent studies have shown that features like the use of common vs. rare synonyms [3], discussion thread [2] and external sources of knowledge [36] are quite effective to infer irony in other languages. It would be interesting to investigate similar features for the Arabic language.</title>
