While speaking, people often use heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues\nlike rolling of the eyes, hand movement, etc. to reveal sarcastic. In the textual data, these tonal and\ngestural clues are missing, making sarcasm detection very difficult for an average human. Due to these\nchallenges, researchers show interest in sarcasm detection of social media text, especially in tweets.\nRapid growth of tweets in volume and its analysis pose major challenges. In this paper, we proposed a\nHadoop based framework that captures real time tweets and processes it with a set of algorithms which\nidentifies sarcastic sentiment effectively. We observe that the elapse time for analyzing and processing\nunder Hadoop based framework significantly outperforms the conventional methods and is more suited\nfor real time streaming tweets.\n& 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

The\nmapper class works as a partitioner and divides large volume of\ntweets into small chunks and distributes them among the nodes in\nthe Hadoop cluster. The reducer class works as a combiner and is\nresponsible for collecting processed tweets from each node in the\ncluster and assembles them to produce the final output. Apache\nFlume [\n        \n        ] is used for capturing tweets in real time as it is highly\nreliable, distributed and configurable. Flume uses an elegant\ndesign to make data loading easy and efficient from several sources\ninto the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) [\n        \n        ]. For\nprocessing these tweets stored in the HDFS, we use Apache Hive [\n        \n        ]. It\nprovides us with an SQL-like language called HiveQL to convert\nqueries into mapper and reducer classes [\n        \n        ].

Utsumi and Akira [\n          \n          ] discussed extreme adjectives and\nadverbs and how the presence of these two intensifies the text.\nMost often, it provides an implicit way to display negative\nattitudes, i.e., sarcasm.
