Whereas other types of fabrications\naim to instill a false sense of truth in the reader, a\nsuccessful satirical hoax must eventually be\nexposed as a jest. This paper provides a conceptual\noverview of satire and humor, elaborating and\nillustrating the unique features of satirical news,\nwhich mimics the format and style of journalistic\nreporting. Satirical news stories were carefully\nmatched and examined in contrast with their\nlegitimate news counterparts in 12 contemporary\nnews topics in 4 domains (civics, science,\nbusiness, and ?soft? news). Building on previous\nwork in satire detection, we proposed an\nSVMbased algorithm, enriched with 5 predictive\nfeatures (Absurdity, Humor, Grammar, Negative\nAffect, and Punctuation) and tested their\ncombinations on 360 news articles. Our best predicting\nfeature combination (Absurdity, Grammar and\nPunctuation) detects satirical news with a 90%\nprecision and 84% recall (F-score=87%). Our\nwork in algorithmically identifying satirical news\npieces can aid in minimizing the potential\ndeceptive impact of satire."
