                    "p": "A large community of research has been developed in recent years to analyze social media and social networks, with the aim of understanding, discovering insights, and exploiting the available information. The focus has shifted from conventional polarity classi cation to contemporary applicationoriented ne-grained aspects such as, emotions, sarcasm, stance, rumor, and hate speech detection in the user-generated content. Detecting a sarcastic tone in natural language hinders the performance of sentiment analysis tasks. The majority of the studies on automatic sarcasm detection emphasize on the use of lexical, syntactic, or pragmatic features that are often unequivocally expressed through gurative literary devices such as words, emoticons, and exclamation marks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model called sAtt-BLSTM convNet that is based on the hybrid of soft attention-based bidirectional long shortterm memory (sAtt-BLSTM) and convolution neural network (convNet) applying global vectors for word representation (GLoVe) for building semantic word embeddings. In addition to the feature maps generated by the sAtt-BLSTM, punctuation-based auxiliary features are also merged into the convNet. The robustness of the proposed model is investigated using balanced (tweets from benchmark SemEval 2015 Task 11) and unbalanced (approximately 40000 random tweets using the Sarcasm Detector tool with 15000 sarcastic and 25000 non-sarcastic messages) datasets. An experimental study using the training- and test-set accuracy metrics is performed to compare the proposed deep neural model with convNet, LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM with/without attention and it is observed that the novel sAtt-BLSTM convNet model outperforms others with a superior sarcasm-classi cation accuracy of 97.87% for the Twitter dataset and 93.71% for the random-tweet dataset."

RELATED WORK\nThe growing pursuit of Internet users in all forms of social\nmedia has intensi ed researchers' interest to intelligently\nmine the content available, both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. Twitter, currently the most famous micro-blog,\nconnects people across the globe and has a high level of user\ninvolvement. It has gradually emerged as a huge source of\nsentiment-rich data [\n        \n        ]. The keyword ``sentiment analysis''\nwas initially witnessed in the published work [\n        \n        ] in 2003,\nand since then, both primary [\n        \n        ], [\n        \n        ], [\n        \n        ] and secondary\nstudies have been reported across pertinent literature [\n        \n        ] [\n        \n        ].\nFurthermore, the literature is well-equipped with studies\npertaining to sentiment analysis using machine learning\nparadigms on speci cally textual user-generated online\ncontent on social media. Alou and El Saddik [\n        \n        ] proposed a\nmodel for sentiment analysis of football speci c tweets using\nthree classi ers, namely, support vector machine,\nmultinomial Navies Bayes and random forest. Pai and Liu [\n        \n        ] put\nforward a model for prediction of vehicle sales by sentiment\nanalysis of twitter data and stock market values using least\nsquares support vector regression. Research using deep\nlearning models for sentiment analysis has also been reported.\nTseng et al. [\n        \n        ] analyzed textual opinions found in teaching\nevaluation questionnaires and applied the analysis results to\nassisting the selection of outstanding teaching faculty\nmembers using attention-based LSTM. Wu and Chi [\n        \n        ] proposed\na model having quadratic connections of LSTM capable\nof capturing complex semantic representations of natural\nlanguage texts and evaluated on the benchmark dataset,\nthe Stanford Sentiment Treebank. Bouazizi and Ohtsuki [\n        \n        ]\nextended the concept of binary or ternary classi cation\nand proposed an approach to classify text collected from\nTwitter into seven sentiment classes. The authors further\nproposed [\n        \n        ] multi-class sentiment analysis which addresses\nthe identi cation of the exact sentiment conveyed by the\nuser using the task of quanti cation that identi es all the\nexisting sentiments within a tweet instead of attributing a\nsingle sentiment label to it. Zhang et al. [\n        \n        ] proposed a\nmodel combining convolution neural network and\nbidirectional gated recurrent unit for sentence semantic classi\ncation. Han et al. [\n        \n        ] used CNN and BLSTM to design\nfour kinds of memory network models for text sentiment\nclassi cation. Fu et al. [\n        \n        ] proposed a lexicon-enhanced\nLSTM model that uses sentiment lexicon as extra information\npre-training a word sentiment classi er. Wang et al.

Studies on bullying and verbal\naggression have been reported deep neural network for\nshort-text sentiment analysis [\n        \n        ]. A few such approaches\nhave been reported for automatic sarcasm detection as well.\nFelbo et al. [\n        \n        ] proposed a DeepMoji model, which is based\non the occurrences of emoji, for detecting the emotional\ncontent on Twitter. It uses a variant of LSTM, a 6-layer model\nthat is a hybrid of BLSTM and the attention mechanism for\nthe detection of sarcastic tweets. A new convolution\nnetworkbased architecture is presented in [\n        \n        ] that learn user\nembeddings in addition to utterance-based embeddings, which\nallows the authors to learn user-speci c context. The\nsimilarity between word embeddings is used by Joshi et al. [\n        \n        ]\nas features for sarcasm detection. The authors have\nconcatenated features from previous works to these word\nembeddingbased features. Ghosh and Veale [\n        \n        ] have built a model\ncombining a convNet with a recurrent neural network (RNN,\nlong short-term memory) followed by a deep neural network.\nIt is observed that this approach shows an improvement for\nthe deep learning architecture when compared with\nrecursive SVM. In [\n        \n        ], models based on a pre-trained convNet\nhave been developed that are used to extract emotion,\nsentiment, and even personality features for sarcasm detection.\nIn another study, [\n        \n        ], bidirectional LSTM is used to\ncapture syntactic and semantic information over tweets, along\nwith a pooling neural network to extract contextual features\nautomatically from history tweets. Performance using neural\nfeatures is compared with discrete manual features and an\nimprovement is observed. Attention mechanism has been\npreviously used by researchers in the domain of natural language\nunderstanding as it selectively focuses on information-rich\nphrases within the sequence of sentence. Recently, authors\nSeo et al. [\n        \n        ] and Wang et al. [\n        \n        ] demonstrated the effective\nuse of attention for compression and question-answering.\nIII. AUTOMATED SARCASM DETECTION\nThe proposed framework for automatic sarcasm detection has\nfour key components, namely, (A) data acquisition, (B)\npreprocessing, (C) implementation of the sAtt-BLSTM\nconvNet model, and (D) evaluation using performance measures.\nThese are explained in detail in the following subsections.\nA. DATASET ACQUISITION\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the\nfollowing datasets have been used for empirical analysis. The\npurpose of using two varied datasets was to further validate\nthe results achieved and determine the robustness of the\nselected features and the model trained on these features.\n1) BALANCED DATASET: SEMEVAL 2015 TASK 11\nThe original SemEval dataset consists of 20000\nhashtagannotated tweets, which were created for the Twitter\nsentiment analysis task. SemEval 2015 task 11 [\n        \n        ] de ned the\nchallenge as a ``dataset for sentiment analysis of gurative\nlanguage on Twitter.'' The objective of the task is speci cally\nto evaluate the use of gurative language, where the word\nor phrase described as `` gurative'' meant that it is being\nused in a way that was symbolic and represented something\nother than its concrete meaning. Although gurative language\nencompasses an extensive variety of literary tools and\ntechniques, such as similes, emoticons, metaphor, personi\ncation, idiom, and hyperbole, this benchmark dataset contains\ntweets with speci c gurative types, namely, sarcasm, irony,\nand metaphor. The sarcasm corpus is thus constructed by\ncollecting self-annotated tweets with the hashtags #irony,\n#sarcasm, and #not. Although there is a subtle difference\nbetween the three, we consider all of them in the same\ncategory for performing this empirical analysis. Thus, this\nstudy is also indicative of how this generalization in uences\nthe obtained results. The experiments used the SemEval 2013\ntask 2 dataset as the negative class data [\n        \n        ]. Manual perusal\nof the two datasets revealed that both contain tweets from\ngeneral topics, thus avoiding any bias in our experimentation.\nTo collect data for the experiments, we tried to retrieve\n15961 tweets using a list of the dataset's tweet ids provided,\nout of which 7994 are sarcastic and 7324 are non-sarcastic.\n2) IMBLANCED DATASET: RANDOM TWEETS\nIn real time, the presence of sarcasm in tweets is less frequent.\nA randomly sampled dataset containing 15,000 sarcastic\nand 25,000 non-sarcastic tweets is built using the Sarcasm\nDetector tool.1\nB. PRE-PROCESSING\nAfter the data acquisition, to intelligently mine the text,\nthe tweets are pre-processed to clean and transform the\ndata for feature extraction [\n        \n        ]. These include the following\nprocesses."

THE PROPOSED sATT-BLSTM CONVNET MODEL\nThe proposed deep learning model uses 8 layers: the input\nlayer, embedding layer, BLSTM layer, attention layer,\nconvolution layer, activation and ReLU layer, max pooling layer,\nand representation layer. Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of\nthe proposed multi-layer model. The details of each layer are\nprovided in the subsequent subsections.\n1) INPUT LAYER\nThe tweets after pre-processing are fed to the input layer. The\ninput layer is connected to the embedding layer, which builds\nword embeddings using GloVe.\n2) EMBEDDING LAYER\nThe embedding layer maps the input into real-valued vectors\nusing encoding from look-up tables. Word embeddings\nfacilitate learned word representations. The bene ts of extracting\nfeatures based on word embedding to detect sarcasm have\nbeen recently reported [\n        \n        ]. In this study, to build word\nembeddings, GloVe, which generates a word vector table,\nis used. GloVe is a count-based model of representing words\nby feature vectors. This log-bilinear model studies the\nrelationship of words by counting the number of times they\nco-occur. Thus, this model aids in mapping all the tokenized\nwords in each tweet to their respective word vector tables.\nProper padding is performed to unify the feature vector\nmatrix. That is, if the total number of given tweets is Z and\nthere is a tweet X with t tokens, generation of a word vector\nTable 5 with dimension d of the word vectors is completed\nusing GloVe. Thus, for all Z, each t in X is mapped to its\nrespective V. After this mapping, each X is expressed as\na vector of the word embeddings concatenation (E). Thus,\nthe feature vector matrix is obtained as shown in (1)."
