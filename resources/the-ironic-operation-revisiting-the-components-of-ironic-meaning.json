Focusing on the logical relationship between the expressed and the intended meaning of the ironic utterance, several real instantiations of the phenomenon are discussed and it is demonstrated that the vehicle (i.e. the unit of meaning that is used in an ironic way, thus carrying the ironic intent) does not always coincide with the input (i.e. the unit of meaning on which irony operates). The input to the ironic operation is thus shown to be of three kinds: (a) part of the vehicle, (b) triggered by the vehicle, or (c) discourse-dependent. The final discussion highlights the advantages of viewing irony as an operation rather than an act of mention or dissociation from the content of the utterance. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recognising the speaker?s dissociative attitude is, according to this view, a shortcut to the speaker?s\nintended meaning, which bypasses the literal interpretation. What some of these approaches seem to be taking for granted is\nthat the identification of the speaker?s dissociative attitude (or higher level explicature) leads directly to the speaker?s intended\nmeaning. As shown earlier (section 2.2), the speaker?s intended meaning is a bundle of interrelated propositions: there are\npropositions that have to do with asserting something other than what is said and propositions that are purely evaluative -- the\nformer do not always coincide with the latter. So how does recognising the speaker?s dissociative attitude facilitate the\nretrieval of these implicatures? Although some of them may be straightforward (dissociative attitude -- act of evaluation),\nothers may require further stages (the speaker doesn?t mean p -- the speaker means the reverse of p). Taking everything into\nconsideration, a dissociative attitude model does not necessarily lead to direct-access processing and is not necessarily less\ncomplex than the process that involves the literal interpretation."

Even if we assume the more relaxed definition of echo/echoic attribution (i.e. what is echoed is not necessarily a\nprevious utterance, but it can be a thought, a situation, or something that a different speaker would have said under\ndifferent circumstances) the irony needs to coincide with the echo, in other words, if an utterance is echoed, then it is the\nutterance as a whole that carries the irony, nothing more or nothing less.

Through the examination of real (spontaneous and scripted) instantiations of the\nphenomenon, the terms ??ironic operation??, ??input??, ??vehicle??, and ??(direct) output?? were defined and distinguished from\neach other. The output was analysed as a bundle of propositions, which include -- but are not limited to -- the direct result of\nthe ironic operation (direct output). Even more crucially, a distinction between ironic vehicle and ironic input was drawn,\nshowing that ironic strategies vary depending on the relationship between the two (input as part of the vehicle, triggered by\nthe vehicle, or dependent on the discourse functions of the vehicle). The subsequent analysis supported the view of irony\nas an operation of reversal: regardless of whether the input is a proposition or a subsentential element, irony exhibits\nsystematicity as it concerns the relationship between input and direct output.",
                        "The discussion also highlighted the fact that the input is always linked to the literal meaning of the utterance, which\nmakes a strong argument for a model that recognises the role of the literal meaning, contrary to what has been proposed\nby the so-called expressivist approach. Further arguments against the expressivist approach, complemented by\narguments that criticise the expressivist-semanticist dichotomy for being restrictive and not based on a true opposition,\nlead to the proposal of a model that recognises the dynamic nature and discourse-dependence of ironic meaning. It is\nhoped that this approach will contribute to future theoretical as well as empirical studies on irony, since the proposed\ndistinctions not only offer a clearer view of the phenomenon but can also be a source of valuable methodological\ndistinctions (e.g. perceptual studies could use ??source of input?? as an additional predictor)."
